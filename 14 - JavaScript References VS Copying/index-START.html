    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    //this reassigns the first variable but the second remains what it was originally assigned
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Ryan";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2) //they will be the same
    name2 = "Kelley"
    console.log(name, name2) //again, the first has changed but not the second




    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log("the original", players, "and the copy", team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = "Dewey";
    console.log(team) //now it's "Dewey" instead of "Poppy"
    console.log(players) //but now this has been changed too!
    console.clear()
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    //remember that array.slice returns a NEW array which is a portion of the old one. so:
    const ryan = players.slice(2, 3);
    console.log(ryan); //["Ryan"]
    //But now if we change the team2 array it will not affect the players array.
    team2[3] = "Sam";
    console.log(players, team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
